FILTER DATA PROJECT - 

This is a small JavaScript project that I have built in which it should wire up two filters for a fictitious website. The filter buttons show only filtered items and a filter search bar can be used to show only filtered items.

Purpose - 

To filter data records shown on the webpage and does not allow you to navigate from one place to another or processes your order unfortunately.
